# Renaissance_Simulation_Assistant_Android
There's a board game of an Italian Renaissance Simulation that one of my old high school teachers created, and a friend of mine made a copy of it. This application is to keep track of turn information, such as calculate the income you'd receive at the start of a turn. The game is basically a more complicated version of risk, and normally one has to write everything on a worksheet. This application is meant to replace the worksheet, and speed up some of the most time consuming portions of the game. This is the android implementation of the app.

# Renaissance_Simulation_Assistant_Android
There's a board game of an Italian Renaissance Simulation that one of my old high school teachers created, and a friend of mine made a copy of it. This application is to keep track of turn information, such as calculate the income you'd receive at the start of a turn. The game is basically a more complicated version of risk, and normally one has to write everything on a worksheet. This application is meant to replace the worksheet, and speed up some of the most time consuming portions of the game. This is the android implementation of the app.

There are plans to add features such as turn history, turn numbering, and API calls so all of the turns can be submitted to one location, and be read in unison. Players submit all of their turn criteria at the same time, thus it would be only be fair that everything is in a readable format from a single location such as a webpage to moreover prevent cheating. It's a complex game with a lot of unbalanced features, so I'm trying my best to avoid the details. If someone who's reading this is intrigued, think of the game as being a cross between Monopoly and Risk, where the game never ends, and you can be voted to become the pope and overpower everyone. Also you never want to be the Holy Roman Empire...
